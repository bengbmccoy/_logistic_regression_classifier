# _logistic_regression_classifier
A logistic regression classifier for general use

This logistic regression classifier is expected to be a "off the shelf" usable
script that can generally be helpful in future use.

Thanks to Andrew Ng and Stanford Uni, as this logistic regression classifier
is based on material taught in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.

An example of the usage in the command line:
python .\logistic_regression_classifier.py .\simple_training.csv Y X1 X2

TODO:
- Fix the plot function so that is can plot multiple J_histories
- Create a new function that takes a sex of X values and predicts the most
  likely class
